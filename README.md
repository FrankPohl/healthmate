Using Azure Cognitive Services to put in body parameters like blood pressure, pulse and glucose.

The goal of this app is to provide an app for people who cannot deal with computers very well.
Therefore it should be necessary to use a keyboard or a mouse to input the desired values.

There are other functions in the app that are more complicated but the main purpose, gather input with your just your voice is achived.

The app welcomes the user directly on the input and awaits speech input.

# technical details
The app is implemented as a Xamarin.Forms app following the template Visual Studio provides.

 Therefore I had to install the Newtonsoft JSon nuget package
